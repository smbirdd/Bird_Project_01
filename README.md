# Bird_Project_01

In this project, I plan to utilize several folders in order to produce the reports needed. I will document what can be found in which folder below:

  - Background: In this folder I will place all of the information regarding the background of the information that will be studied through the course of the analysis.
  - Code: In this folder, you can find all relevant code integral to the production of the analyses requested.
  - DataProcessed: In this folder, you can find all the data after it has been processed.
  - DataRaw: In this folder, you can find all raw data in it's untouched form.
  - Reports: You can find all reports in this folder for use.
